# Seeker

The intention of this project is to create a portal for consultants to easily estimate the costs of Construction equipment and rentals.

### at this stage in time we will just use mock data...

but my plans if this project continues will be to use live updates from multiple different sources to provide the lowest available cost for quotes.

# to run the development build.

### `npm run devStart`
